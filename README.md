# multifractal

Python library for creating multifractal measures and analysing them. 

Plotting and animating multinomial measures. Beyond 10 iterations matplotlib does not display the measures correctly, but it can be checked that the extreme values of the measure are at the leftmost and rightmost inerval, in the case of the binomial measure. 

Method of moments 

partition_plot(renorm=False)

renorm - Boolean, determines if the plot of the partition function wil be renormalized by vertical replacement to 0. 

-estimate a multinomial measures specturm with iter - integer, will determine the number of iterations
